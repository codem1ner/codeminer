# Developer Resources
Recommended resources for learning web development (based on bitter experience...)

## Bootcamps, Tutorials and Courses
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) - an excellent starting point for anyone (I'm currently using it). Minor gripe: it references too many external resources from the outset, which can be distracting.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) is a superb resource point for those starting out in web development.
- [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/): just superb. Can't add anything
- [Interneting is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/)

## Javascript
- [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke
